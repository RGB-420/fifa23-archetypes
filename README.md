# âš½ FIFA 23 Player Archetypes

This project analyzes FIFA 23 player data to identify **15 archetypes** (5 for each position group: defenders, midfielders, and forwards) using **KMeans clustering**. The resulting archetypes are visualized with **radar charts** to provide an intuitive understanding of different playing styles.
